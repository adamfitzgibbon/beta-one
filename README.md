My take on the AlphaZero game-playing machine learning algorithm.

I build this project while following along with the [freeCodeCamp.org](freeCodeCamp.org) tutorial, [AlphaZero from Scratch - Machine Learning Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wuSQpLinRB4). They're a great resource, so go support their content!
